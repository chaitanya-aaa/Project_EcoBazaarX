## 1. Project Title  
**EcoBazaarX – Carbon Footprint Aware Shopping Assistant**

## 2. Abstract and Summary  
E-commerce platforms have revolutionized shopping but often overlook their environmental impact.  
EcoBazaarX is designed to **increase carbon footprint awareness** by showing users the eco-impact of purchases, providing **sustainable product suggestions**, and encouraging **green shipping alternatives**.  
By integrating **role-based dashboards** and **analytics**, the platform empowers customers, shopkeepers, and admins to make informed, sustainable, and secure shopping decisions.

## 3. Problem Statement  
- Traditional e-commerce platforms prioritize **convenience and speed**, neglecting **sustainability**.  
- Consumers lack awareness of the **carbon emissions** generated by production, packaging, and logistics.  
- Absence of **role-specific insights** prevents stakeholders (customers, sellers, admins) from acting on sustainability goals.  
- Secure, eco-aware transactions are rarely emphasized in online marketplaces.
